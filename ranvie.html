  <p style = "color: white; text-color: white; width: 100%;">I usually go by the name Ranviee, but you can call me "Ran." I am currently a first year university student, who currently major in computer engineering... something in Thammasat University. I have a couples of hobbies, ranging from making high-ish effort meme videos to tinkering with obsolete tech. I specialize in making 3D models, background images, and graphics in general. Feel free to hang out with me on Discord, or check out my Youtube channel. Keep in mind that most of the contents are not in English.</p>
